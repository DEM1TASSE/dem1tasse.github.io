  <p>
    Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Ruohan (Demi) Wang, an undergraduate student at <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/" target="_blank">Tongji University</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a short term, I'm focused on conducting research on <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong> and learning to be a <strong>full-stack independent developer</strong>. In the long run, I hope to build a startup and contribute to the development of <strong>AGI</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've gained research experience through internships at <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/en/" target="_blank">ByteDance</a> and <a href="https://x.com/osunlp" target="_blank">OSU NLP Group</a> (supervised by <a href="https://ysu1989.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Yu Su</a>). I'm currently focused on <strong>language agents</strong> and <strong>multimodal models</strong>.
  </p>
